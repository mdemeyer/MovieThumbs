MovieThumbs generates thumbnails for movies and series.

For downloading the posters a working internet connection is needed. MovieThumbs works with all KDE file managers and nautilus.
If the wrong thumbnail is downloaded include the year when the movie was released in the file name. This will help fetch the correct poster.
All information that is between brackets () and [] will not be used to search. You can still put the year in brackets.

Posters are downloaded from tmdb.org (The Movie DataBase)
api documentation: http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/

I would like to thank the tmdb team for allowing the use of their api.

External dependencies:
    Qt 5

    KDE SC 5 (for KDE)
    nautilus (for gnome)

Installation:
